            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-medium">Finally, it is our policy to notify people who use our service of
                requests for their information prior to disclosure unless we are prohibited by law from doing so or in
                exceptional circumstances, such as child exploitation cases, emergencies or when notice would be
                counterproductive. Law enforcement officials who believe that notification would jeopardize an
                investigation should obtain an appropriate court order or other appropriate process establishing that
                notice is prohibited. If your data request draws attention to an ongoing violation of our terms of use,
                we will take action to prevent further abuse, including actions that may notify the user that we are
                aware of their misconduct.</p>
