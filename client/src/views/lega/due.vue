            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-medium">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation from the
                European Union (EU) that aims to harmonize data-protection legislation across EU member states by
                enhancing privacy rights for individuals within the EU. It applies to organizations processing personal
                data that offer goods or services to individuals in the EU. It also grants EU-based data subjects
                certain rights to control the data that organizations collect on them, and how organizations use that
                information.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-medium">At Stack Overflow, we are committed to your privacy, whether you live
                in the EU, or outside of it. This means we believe in data accountability, data consistency and data
                transparency. As such, we describe how we collect and use your data, and how we use technologies like
                cookies to understand how we can better help developers.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-medium">Additionally, if you are purchasing Stack Overflow products or
                services, we want you to know that we take our responsibilities to protect the personal data of our
                community very seriously.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-medium">We provide this portal so you can access certain features that help you
                understand what we do with your data, how we protect your data, and options you may have to better
                access and understand our use of your data.</p>
