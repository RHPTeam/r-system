            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-medium">Stack Overflow users meet the GDPR definition of "data subjects." Data
                subjects are provided two key rights under the GDPR, including “the right to data portability” and “the
                right to be forgotten.”
                You have the ability to exercise these rights via our data subject access rights page where you may <a
                    href="/legal/gdpr/request">submit a Request</a>.
                And because we care about your privacy rights we make these access requests available to you whether
                you are in the EU or not.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-medium">
                Stack Overflow now makes it easy for you to request any information we store on you, to understand how
                that information has been collected, and to know who we have shared your information with. We’ve
                revised our <a href="/legal/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="/legal/cookie-policy">Cookies
                    Policy</a> to provide more details about how we collect, use, transfer, and safeguard your
                information.
