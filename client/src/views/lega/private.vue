                        consent. Stack Overflow will not unreasonably withhold our consent if the assignee agrees to be
                        bound by the then-current Private Network Terms. Stack Overflow reserves the right to assign
                        our rights and obligations under these Private Network Terms (in whole or in part) without
                        Entity's consent to a corporate affiliate, or in connection with a merger, acquisition,
                        corporate restructure or reorganization, or due to the sale of all or substantially all of our

                        in accordance with the applicable laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the
                        principles of that State regarding conflicts of laws. Each party irrevocably agrees to the sole
                        and exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Courts of the State of New York with respect to any
                        action, suit, or proceeding brought by it or against it by the other party. Notwithstanding the
                        foregoing, these Private Network Terms shall not prevent either party from seeking injunctive
                        relief with respect to a violation of the confidentiality provisions and indemnification
                        provisions contained in these Private Network Terms. The United Nations Convention for the
                        International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Private Network Terms. No shrinkwrap or

                        Network Terms as our business evolves over time and to better provide Services and Products to
                        the Stack Overflow community. If we make a material change to these Private Network Terms,
                        Stack will provide Entity Representative with reasonable notice of such material change
                        (materiality to be determined solely by Stack Overflow). Entity Representative can review the
                        modified Private Network Terms prior to such material changes going into effect, and such
                        changes will go into effect on the date listed in the modified Private Network Terms. If Entity
                        Representative accesses or uses the Services or Products following such effective date, such
                        access or use shall constitute acceptance of the modified Private Network Terms.</p>

                        association between the parties creating any employment relationship. These Private Network
                        Terms represent the entire agreement between Entity and Stack Overflow and supersedes all prior
                        or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect
                        to the Services or Products offered hereunder (including any Alpha or Beta Agreements). If any
                        provision of these Private Network Terms is held to be invalid, void, unenforceable, or
                        contrary to public policy, the remaining provisions of these Private Network Terms shall remain
                        and continue in full force and effect.</p>

                        shall not constitute a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of these
                        Private Network Terms. Waiver of compliance in any particular instance does not mean that we
                        will waive compliance in the future. In order for any waiver of compliance with these Private
                        Network Terms to be binding, we must provide you with written notice of such waiver through one
                        of our authorized representatives.</p>
