            <p>After the lengthy preamble, comes the inevitable question. Which method (do you think) is best?</p>
            <p class="p_0 m_0">The __slots__ declaration takes a sequence of instance variables and reserves just enough space in each instance to hold a value for each variable. Space is saved because __dict__ is not created for each instance.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                There is one additional feature provided by Python though for tiny objects, the __slots__ attribute. The class could be expressed as:
            </li>
            <li>
                (edit- Just to be clear, y0, y1 and y2 are just meant as abstract identifiers. As pointed out, in practice you'd use meaningful identifiers)
            </li>
            <li>
                (edit- Just to be clear, y0, y1 and y2 are just meant as abstract identifiers. As pointed out, in practice you'd use meaningful identifiers)
            </li>
