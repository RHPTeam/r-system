                There is one additional feature provided by Python though for tiny objects, the __slots__ attribute. The class could be expressed as:
            </li>
            <li>
                (edit- Just to be clear, y0, y1 and y2 are just meant as abstract identifiers. As pointed out, in practice you'd use meaningful identifiers)
            </li>
            <li>
