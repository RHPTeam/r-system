# Documentation R-Sytem for RHP Team

> The R-System is an idea that comes from the RHP Team members. The system uses Node.js as the core to write API and use Vue.js as a framework for users. The team implemented this system to create a place to store the products that members created. At the same time, Team integrates a system of questioning and answering for everyone, this idea is in part for members to practice skills and also contribute products to the community.

## How to clone project?
So this github link is integrated both server and client, so if you want to run, you need to follow the steps below:

**Setup Server Folder**

The system uses the API method to communicate with the client, so you need to run the `server` folder. The purpose of this, you will get the data to display on the user side.

Go to `server` folder
```
cd server
```
Install all package for server
```
npm install
```
Run for development
```
npm run dev
```
Run for production
```
npm run start
```

**Setup Client Folder**

Before proceeding to the next step, make sure that you have run the `server` folder. If you haven't done so already, the next run may report an error and won't work.

Go to `client` folder
```
cd client
```
Install all package for server
```
npm install
```
